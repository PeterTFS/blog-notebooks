    "Testing is one of my favourite things about programming. There is nothing like the piece of mind that comes from being able to modify code without having to worry about breaking something.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most Python programmers, I started testing using the [PyUnit framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) (aka `unittest`) included in [Python's Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/index.html). PyUnit is part of the [xUnit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit) family of testing frameworks. There are [lots](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Unit-Testing-guide-developers/dp/1935182579) [of](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530) [great](https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627) [resources](https://www.amazon.com/xUnit-Test-Patterns-Refactoring-Code/dp/0131495054) on how to test using xUnit which is great!\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is also the not great: xUnit has its roots in Java so PyUnit is verbose. Tests need to be [grouped into classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#organizing-test-code), [special `assert*` methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#assert-methods) are required for verification, and the object-oriented design of PyUnit results in [over-engineered tests](https://www.petrikainulainen.net/programming/unit-testing/3-reasons-why-we-should-not-use-inheritance-in-our-tests/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) shines. pytest gets out of our way so we can spend our time writing tests versus boilerplate code."

    "The benfits of pytest are most clearly seen in the implementation of [fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html). Test fixtures allow us to [setup assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_fixture#Software) for our system under test (SUT); this makes it possible to create reproducible results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of test fixtures include:\n",
    "* setting up a database to a preconfigured state\n",
    "* cleaning up a database after tests are run\n",
    "* capturing logging output\n",
    "* loading test data from a JSON file; great for testing webhooks!\n",
